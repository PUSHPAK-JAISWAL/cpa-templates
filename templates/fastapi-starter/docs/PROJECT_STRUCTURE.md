# Project Structure

`fastapi-starter` uses a feature-based architecture inspired by
Create-Node-App's `react-vite-starter` and the NaNLABS FastAPI boilerplate.

## Adding A Feature

1. Copy `app/features/_feature_template_` to `app/features/<feature_name>`.
2. Rename imports from `app.features._feature_template_` to your feature module.
3. Define Pydantic models in `schemas.py`.
4. Keep business rules and external calls in `service.py`.
5. Expose HTTP endpoints from `router.py`.
6. Mount the feature router in `app/api/router.py`.

## Response Envelope

Feature routes should return `APIResponse[T]` from
`app.schemas.common.responses`. This keeps success, error, metadata, and request
ID handling consistent across the API.

## Request IDs

`RequestIDMiddleware` reads `X-Request-ID` when provided or creates a UUID. The
ID is available at `request.state.request_id`, returned in response metadata,
and echoed in the `x-request-id` response header.
